# Contributing to the list

Anyone can contribute, but this is an opinionated list, so I may not accept all contributions as-is.

## What belongs

Any osu!-related project, except:

- Projects so dated that they aren't helpful anymore (unless its purpose is to archive)
- Very new projects that remain unpopular due to not being useful

## Ordering

Things in each category are roughly in order of how important or useful they are.
